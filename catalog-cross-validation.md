# Setting up a target account
{: #catalog-cross-validation}

If you want to use a different account to validate your product and run security and compliance scans, you can add a target account. You can add a target account by using an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key or a trusted profile ID. In addition, you can link your private catalog with a project, allowing the project to create the resources in the target account rather than having them created directly by the catalog. 
{: shortdesc}

You might want to use a target account for the following reasons:

- Prevent the account with the product from becoming cluttered with resources that are created and deleted as part of the onboarding process
- Allow users to complete onboarding when they might not have authorization to create resources in the account that contains the product

## Before you begin
{: #catalog-cross-begin}

1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more details.
1. Make sure that you have the [administrator role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management) or have the catalog administrator complete this task.
1. Set up [service-to-service authorization](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-catalog-service-authorization).
1. If you want to use an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key, [create an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key) for the target account.
1. If you want to use a trusted profile ID, see [Creating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui).
1. If you want to link a private catalog with a project, you must have a catalog and a project created. For more information on creating a private catalog, see [Customizing the IBM Cloud catalog and private catalogs for users in your account](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user&interface=ui). For more information on creating a project, see [Creating a project](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-setup-project&interface=ui).

## Using an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key
{: #target-api-key}

You can add a target account by using an API key. Alternatively, if you would like to add a trusted profile ID, see [Using a trusted profile](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-cross-validatione&interface=ui#target-trusted-profile).

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Catalogs > Private catalogs** to access your private catalogs.
1. Select the private catalog that you want to add a target account to.
1. Click **Actions...** > **Edit catalog details** > **Add** to add a target account.
1. Select **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key** as the method.
1. Create a programmatic name of the target account.
1. Create a display name for the target account. The display name appears as a target account option for users that are onboarding products.
1. Enter the API key for the target account. If you need an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key).
1. Click the checkbox to indicate that you set up service authorization for Schematics and Catalog Management.
1. Click **Add** > **Update**.

Users can now use the added target account to validate and add scans to any product version in the private catalog.

## Using a trusted profile
{: #target-trusted-profile}

If you want to use a trusted profile, you need to update your trusted profile to include the private catalog's CRN as a trust relationship. If you need to create a trusted profile, see [Creating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui).

### Updating a trusted profile
{: #update-create-profile}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Catalogs > Private catalogs** to access your private catalogs.

1. Enter the CRN and click **Save**.
1. Click **Details** to find the `Profile ID` of the trusted profile.

## Using an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} project ID
{: #target-project-id}

You can configure a target account for a private catalog with a project. If you link your catalog to a project, you can synchronize the status between them, for example, when you create a new software with a specific version in your catalog, a configuration is created in your project with the same version. After you link your catalog with a project, you can validate your version either in Catalog management, or in Projects, but you only need to validate it once. 

You must have a private catalog and a project created before you can configure a target account and link your catalog to a project. For more information on creating a private catalog, see [Customizing the IBM Cloud catalog and private catalogs for users in your account](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user&interface=ui). For more information on creating a project, see [Creating a project](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-setup-project&interface=ui).
