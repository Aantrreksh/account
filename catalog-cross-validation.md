# Setting up a target account
{: #catalog-cross-validation}

If you want to use a different account to validate your product and run security and compliance scans, you can add a target account. You can add a target account by using an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key or a trusted profile ID.
{: shortdesc}

You might want to use a target account for the following reasons:

- Prevent the account with the product from becoming cluttered with resources that are created and deleted as part of the onboarding process
- Allow users to complete onboarding when they might not have authorization to create resources in the account that contains the product

## Before you begin
{: #catalog-cross-begin}

1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more details.
1. Make sure you have the [administrator role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management) or have the catalog administrator complete this task.
1. Set up [service-to-service authorization](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-catalog-service-authorization).
1. If you want to use an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key, [create an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key) for the target account.
1. If you want to use a trusted profile ID, see [Creating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui).
