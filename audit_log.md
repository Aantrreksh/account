# Auditing system events for classic infrastructure 
{: #audit-log}

If you have a classic infrastructure account, you can monitor storage replication events by viewing audit logs. Audit logs track the interactions of each user, like login attempts, port speed updates, power restarts, and interactions made by {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure support staff.
{:shortdesc}


## Viewing your audit log in the console
{: #view-audit-log}
{: ui}

To view your audit log, go to **Manage > Account** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, and select **Audit log**. The audit log initially displays the last 25 interactions that were taken by users on the account. You can view up to 200 interactions at any time. Expand the items per page menu to see more results.

### Viewing a user's access logs
{: #view-access-logs}

From the audit log page, you can also see data for each access attempt that is made by a specific user. The logs display a date and timestamp and IP address for each access attempt. Use the following steps to view a user's Access Logs.

1. In the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Audit log**.
2. Then, filter for the user, select the timeframe that you want to view, and choose an object type.  

The access log for each user displays the access attempts that were made by that user by date, along with the IP address from which the access attempt was made. Information within the access log is read-only.

### Granting access to the audit log
{: #grant-access-logs}

The Viewer role or higher on all account management services is required to view the audit log. For classic infrastructure permissions, a user must be assigned the Super user role. 

## Viewing your audit log by using the SoftLayer API
{: #view-audit-log-api}
{: api}

You can use the SoftLayer API to view your audit log. The {{site.data.keyword.slapi_full}} is the development interface that gives developers and system administrators direct interaction with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} backend system. The {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} powers many of the features in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, which typically means if an interaction is possible in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, it can also be run in the API. Because you can programmatically interact with all portions of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment within the API, {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} enables you to automate tasks. 

The {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} is a Remote Procedure Call system. Each call involves sending data towards an API endpoint and receiving structured data in return. The format used to send and receive data with the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} depends on which implementation of the API you choose. The {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} currently uses SOAP, XML-RPC or REST for data transmission.

To programmatically audit system events for classic infrastructure, call the {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} as shown in the following example: 

```bash
https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3.1/SoftLayer_Event_Log/getAllObjects.json?
                    resultLimit=0,50&
                    objectMask=mask[eventName,eventCreateDate,userType]

curl -g -u $SL_USER:$SL_APIKEY 'https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3.1/SoftLayer_Event_Log/getAllObjects.json?objectMask=mask[eventName,eventCreateDate,userType]&resultLimit=0,50'

The output will look something like this,in this case just the first event in the list:

[
    {
        "eventCreateDate": "2021-03-29T14:41:55.444089-06:00",
        "eventName": "Login Successful",
        "userType": "CUSTOMER"
    }
  ]

To get all Events logs, use [SoftLayer_Event_Log::getAllObjects()](https://softlayer.github.io/reference/services/SoftLayer_Event_Log/getAllObjects/). In this case just the first 50 events are returned by using pagination limit `resultLimit=0,50`. See [Using Result Limits in the SoftLayer API](https://sldn.softlayer.com/article/using-result-limits-softlayer-api/) for more information. A mask is shown in this example, `mask[eventName,eventCreateDate,userType]`, that restricts other local fields and limits the amount of information returned.
{: curl}

This example deals with a few ways of pulling data from `SoftLayer_Event_Log`. There can ben quite a few Logs here, so it is recommended to use a filter, like the `recentLogs` function, to limit how far back you search for Events.
