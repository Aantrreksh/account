# Suspending your product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, you can suspend it for a short time without permanently deleting it. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more customers install it.

The process to sell third-party software is still under development. With the current release, you can bring your own licenses or deliver your third-party software for free. If you have questions, contact us at cloud.onboarding@us.ibm.com.

Complete the following steps to suspend your product:




1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Private catalogs**.
1. Select the private catalog where your product is located.
1. Select your product.
1. Optionally, if you want to suspend a specific version of your software, select that version from the list.

   If your software has only one published version, and you suspend that version, the entire product is suspended.
   {: note}

1. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Suspend**.
1. Explain why you want to suspend your product.
1. Click **Suspend**.

After your product is suspended, you have 7 days to [submit a request to publish it to the catalog again](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-publish). If you don't submit a request within 7 days, your product will be deprecated.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can suspend your product if there's an issue that you need to address. Any updates that you need to make are shared by email. If you do not address any issues with your product within 7 days, your product will be deprecated. When your product is deprecated, it enters a 90-day deprecation period before it is permanently removed from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
