# Publishing products that use Terraform templates
{: #publishtf}

The process to onboard software to your account includes importing a version to a private catalog, validating that the version can be successfully installed on the target infrastructure that you require, and publishing the software to your account. The software is then available to users in your account.
{: shortdesc}



## Before you begin
{: #publishtf-prereq}

1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more details.

1. Review the list of software that you can onboard:

   * Helm charts on Kubernetes and {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} clusters
   * Terraform templates
   * OVA images deployed on VMware Solutions Dedicated - vCenter Server
   * Virtual server images with Terraform deployed on VPC infrastructure
   * Operators with TGZ file from GitHub or GitLab repositories
   * Operator bundles from Red Hat OpenShift registries

1. Upload your source code to a release in your GitHub or GitLab repository. See [Setting up your source code repository](/docs/sell?topic=sell-source-repo-setup).
1. Make sure you're assigned the following [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-groups):

   * Editor role on the catalog management service
   * Viewer role on all resource groups in your account
   * Writer role on the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} service

1. Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} plug-in. See [Setting up the CLI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli) for more information.

For containerized apps, complete the following prerequisites:

   1. Create your [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started) or [Red Hat OpenShift cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started).
   2. For deployments to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service, [set up your Helm chart](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm).
   3. For deployments to Red Hat OpenShift, set up your [Helm chart](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-helm) or [Operator](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-operators).

For virtual server images, complete the following prerequisites:

   1. Review the list of [supported images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).
   2. Create your [Terraform template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-config).
   3. Create an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and add your image to a bucket.









## Configuring the software

1. After you enter all additional license agreements, click **Next**.

## Editing your readme file
{: #publishtf-readme}

When users install the software, they can select the link to your readme file to view product information. The information in the Readme link is generated from the readme file that you uploaded to your source repository.

1. From the Edit readme tab, preview how the information in the readme file will be displayed to users when they install the software.
1. To make updates, click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") next to the Readme section title.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Next**.

## Validating the software
{: #publishtf-validate}
{: ui}

When you validate your software, you're confirming that the current version can be successfully installed on the deployment target. The validation steps vary based on your deployment method.

To monitor the progress of the validation process, click **View logs**.
