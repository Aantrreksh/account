# Setting up access groups
{: #groups}

An access group can be created to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity that makes it easy for you to assign access. You can assign a single policy to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID.
{:shortdesc}

To make assigning and managing access even easier, you can set up resource groups to organize a set of resources that you want a group of users to have access to. When your resource group is set up, you can assign a policy that gives access to all resources within that group instead of creating access policies for individual service instances within your account.

Welcome back to another installment of the IBM Cloud Console Guide. In this video, we will be showing you how to set up an access group. 

Assigning access to users in IBM Cloud individually can be time consuming, especially if you have a large organization. That’s where access groups come in to play.

Access groups allow you to assign a minimal number of policies by giving the same access to all users and service IDs that belong to the same access group. In other words, instead of assigning the same access multiple times to multiple users or service IDs, you can create a group and assign a single policy to that group. This helps save time and keep access permissions organized.

The best practice for setting up access groups is to create one access group per wanted level of access. Then, you can map each access group to the previously created resource groups. For example, you might create Auditor, Developer, and Admin groups, then assign access to these groups based upon the individual’s role.

Now that you know what access groups are and why they’re important, let’s go over how to create an access group.

In the IBM Cloud console, click “Manage” and then “Access (IAM).” Then, select “Access Groups” and click “Create.” 

Here you will enter the name and description for the group. Then, click “Create. 

After you create an access group, you can then add users and service IDs to the group (clicks Users and Service ID tabs within the UI for managing the created access group).

Before we dive into how to assign access to the access groups, you need to understand how IAM access policies provide access. A policy consists of a subject, target, and role (clicks Access policies tab). The subject is the access group. The target will be what you want the subject to access. This could be a set of resources, a service instance, all services in the account, or all instances of a service. 

Access policies can only be set for IAM-enabled services and account management services (clicks "Assign access" button on the Access policies tab for the created access group, then highlights two tiles for IAM-enabled services and Account management services). Cloud Foundry and Classic Infrastructure are separate.

The role defines the level of access granted to a user (Starts creating a policy by selecting All identity and access enabled services, then scrolling the available roles that display). The most commonly used roles are viewer, editor, and administrator. The viewer role provides the least amount of access for viewing instances and resource groups. The editor role allows more access to create, edit, delete, and bind service instances. While the administrator includes everything for working with a service instance and can also assign access to others.

To make assigning access as easy as possible, you can organize resources into a resource group and users and service IDs into an access group. After you set up each one, you can then create access policies for the access groups to give users access to the resources you’ve created.

To get started, click “Manage” in the IBM Cloud console, then click “Access (IAM)” and select “Access Groups.”

Then, select the name of the access group that you want to assign access.

Select the “Access policies” tab, and then click “Assign access.”

Now you will select the type of access that you want to assign (clicks IAM services, selects All identity and access enabled services, selects Administrator platform role, selects Reader service role). Then click “Add” and “Assign.” (Then, clicks "Invite" button.) 

Inviting users to the access group is easy. You can add users directly to each access group by clicking on “Users” and the blue “Invite Users” button.

Thank you for watching this installment of the IBM Cloud Console Guide. 

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-create-groups}

To manage or create new access groups, you must have the following type of access:

* Account owner
* Administrator or editor on the IAM Access Groups account management service in the account
* Administrator or editor for the all Account Management Services

Additionally, an administrator or editor can be assigned access to manage an individual group by creating an access policy where the resource is the Access group ID. For more information about access policies and roles for the IAM Access Groups service, see [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#userroles).

## Creating an access group in the console
{: #create_ag}
{: ui}

To create an access group, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a name and optional description for your group, and click **Create**.

Next, continue to set up your group by adding users or service IDs. Or, you can start assigning the group access, and decide who you want to add to the access group later.

You can delete a group by selecting the **Remove group** option. When you remove a group from the account, you are removing all users and service IDs from the group and all access that is assigned to the group.
{: note}

## Creating an access group by using the CLI
{: #create_ag_cli}
{: cli}

To create an access group by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-create GROUP_NAME [-d, --description DESCRIPTION]
```
{: codeblock}

## Creating an access group by using the API
{: #create_ag_api}
{: api}

You can programmatically create access groups by calling the [{{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) Access Groups API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/iam-access-groups#create-access-group){: external} as shown in the following sample request. The example creates an access group for managers in the account:
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: {iam_token}" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "name": "Managers", "description": "Group for managers" }' \
"{base_url}/groups?account_id={account_id}"
```
{: codeblock}

## Assigning access to a group in the console
{: #access_ag}
{: ui}

After you set up your group with users and service IDs, you can assign a common access policy to the group. Remember, any policy that you set for the group applies to all entities within the group.

1. In the console, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. From the row for the group that you want to assign access, select the **Actions** ![List of actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) menu, and click **Assign access**. 
3. Add one or more of the access options that you manage. You must assign at least one access option. For any access options that you don't add and configure, the default value of **No access** is assigned. Depending on the options that you are authorized to manage, you can assign the following types of access:

     * Select **IAM services**, and then select the option for all services or just a specific service. Next, you can scope the access to the resources based on selected resource attributes like access management tags, region or resource group. Then, select all roles that apply. To view what actions are mapped to each role, click the **Actions for role** option to view a list of all actions that are mapped to a specific role. <br><br> Some services support the use of advanced operators to grant access to resources that satisfy specific naming conventions. See [Assigning access by using wildcard policies](/docs/account?topic=account-wildcard) for more information. 
     
         If you select the **Account** scope for the access policy, the user must already have the Viewer role or higher on the resource group or groups that contain the resources you want the user to have access to. Without a role on a resource group, the user can't work with the resource from the Resource list page in the console.
         {: tip}
     
     * Select **Account management**, and then choose from the all account management services option or select a specific service. Then, select all roles that apply.

   
5. Click **Add** > **Assign**.  

## Assigning access to a group by using the CLI
{: #access_ag_cli}
{: cli}

To create an access group policy by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}
```
{: codeblock}

## Assigning access to a group by using the API
{: #access_ag_api}
{: api}

You can programmatically assign access to a group by calling the [{{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) Policy Management API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/iam-policy-management#create-policy){: external} as shown in the following sample request. The example assigns an access group `Editor` role for an instance of a service:

```
curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/v1/policies' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```
