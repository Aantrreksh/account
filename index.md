## Lite account
{: #liteaccount}

Sign up for a Lite account to start building your apps and exploring services with select free Lite plans, which are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](../icons/Lite.svg) in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Your Lite account doesn't expire and your credit card isn't required.

You have access to a single resource group that's created for you and named `Default`. All of your services instances that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) are automatically added to this resource group. You can update the name of this resource group at any time. See [Renaming a resource group](/docs/account/resourcegroups.html#renaming-a-resource-group) for the detailed steps.

Each resource group is free. When you create a connection between a service managed by IAM and a Cloud Foundry app, you create an alias, which is a service instance, that counts toward your quota. See [What is an alias?](/docs/cfapps/connecting_apps.html#what_is_alias).
{: tip}

### What's available?

You might be wondering what's offered in a Lite account. Check out the following list of key features:

   * The account is free - no credit card required.
   * The account never expires.
   * You can use one org in one {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region.
   * Basic {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support for free. Basic support is provided for non-production environments or workloads where traditional severities are not used and specific response times are not stipulated.
   * You receive email notifications about your account status and quota limits.
   * Your Cloud Foundry apps can access up to 256 MB of free, instantaneous runtime memory.
   * You can provision one instance of any service in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?search=label:lite%20lite){: new_window} that has a Lite plan.
   * After 10 days of no development activity, your apps go to sleep. You can start working on new apps without having to worry about hitting memory quota limits.
   * After 30 days of no development activity, your service instances with Lite plans are deleted. This way, you don't have to manage deleting inactive instances before you create new ones.

### Upgrading your account

When you are ready to grow, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account and pay for only what you use beyond the free allowances. After you upgrade, you can continue using any instances you created with your Lite account. Go to **Manage** > **Billing and Usage** > **Billing** in the console, and click **Add Credit Card**. 

## Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #paygo}

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. Your charges are based on your use of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} compute and services. You're eligible for free runtime and service allowances. If you use more than the free allowance, you receive a monthly {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice. The invoice is in United States dollars (USD) and provides details about your resource charges. 

If you link your Pay-As-You-Go account with a SoftLayer account, starting on the first of the next month, your combined charges are included on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice.
{: tip}

You can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. After you provide your billing and credit card information, accept the terms and conditions and submit your account request. Then, your credit card is validated. You also receive a confirmation email regarding the account information. A few minutes after you receive the confirmation email, you can return to the console to continue building your apps. If your online request can't be processed for your country or region, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html).

You get a promotional credit of $200 after you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, and there's no action required for you to start using it. Your $200 credit is valid for 30 days and it is automatically applied to your invoice. The credit cannot be used with infrastructure or third-party offerings.

### Upgrading your account

You can upgrade your Pay-As-You-Go account to a Subscription account at any time. Contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for more details.

## Subscription account

With a Subscription account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. You commit to a minimum spending amount each month and receive a subscription discount that is applied to that minimum charge. You also pay for any usage that exceeds the minimum spending amount.

If you link your Subscription account with a SoftLayer account, starting on the first of the next month, your combined charges are included on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice.
