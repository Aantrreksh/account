# Account types
{: #accounts}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has three different account types: Lite, Pay-As-You-Go, and Subscription. You get a free Lite account as soon as you sign up.

## Lite account
{: #liteaccount}

Sign up for a Lite account to start building your apps and exploring services with select free Lite plans, which are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](../icons/Lite.svg) in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Your Lite account doesn't expire and your credit card isn't required.

You have access to a single resource group that's created for you and named `Default`. All of your service's instances that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) are automatically added to this resource group. You can update the name of this resource group at any time. See [Renaming a resource group](/docs/resources?topic=resources-rgs#rename_rgs) for the detailed steps.

Each resource group is free. When you create a connection between a service that is managed by IAM and a Cloud Foundry app, you create an alias, which is a service instance, that counts toward your quota. See [Managing connections](/docs/resources?topic=resources-connect_app).
{: tip}

### What's available?
{: #lite-account-features}

   * The account never expires.
   * You can use one org in one {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region.

   * After 10 days of no development activity, your apps go to sleep. You can wake up your apps by continuing to work on them.
   * After 30 days of no development activity, your service instances with Lite plans are deleted.

### Upgrading your Lite account
{: #upgrade-lite-account}

You can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account or Subscription account. For more information, see [How do I upgrade or convert my account type?](/docs/account?topic=account-changeacct).

You get a promotional credit of $200 after you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, and the credit is automatically applied to your account. Your $200 credit is valid for 30 days and is automatically applied to your invoice. The credit cannot be used with third-party offerings.

## Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #paygo}

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. Your charges are based on your use of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} computing and services. You're eligible for free runtime and service allowances. If you use more than the free allowance, you receive a monthly {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice. The invoice is in United States dollars (USD) and provides details about your resource charges.

Also, with a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can order optional items such as advanced or premium support options. Contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for more information.


### Upgrading your Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #upgrade-to-subscription}

To upgrade your Pay-As-You-Go account to a Subscription account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

## Subscription account
{: #subscription-account}

With a Subscription account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. You commit to a combined a minimum spending amount each month and receive a subscription discount that is applied to that minimum charge. You're charged the non-discounted rate for any usage that exceeds your total subscription amount. To view your subscription, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Subscriptions**.

If you have a subscription account, you can create most of the services that are available from the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon"). However, some services use a specific pricing plan that requires you to purchase it separately.

### Service bundle subscriptions
{: #service-subscriptions}

Service bundle subscriptions give you access and credit towards a set of services within a particular domain that are targeted for popular use cases. You can choose from service bundles that span AI, analytics, {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}}, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud-native services. If your needs cross multiple domains, you can purchase multiple service bundle subscriptions.

You can add services bundles to any type of existing account, including Lite accounts. For the first 90 days, you're limited to using the services within the bundle. After the initial 90 days, you can access the full catalog.

Service bundle subscriptions aren't available through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. To learn more and purchase a service bundle, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window}.
{:tip}

After you purchase a service bundle subscription, you'll receive an email with a feature code that you apply to add the bundle to your account. For more information about how to apply feature codes, see [Applying feature codes](/docs/account?topic=account-codes). When your service bundle expires or you use all of the credit, you can continue to use any of the services, with usage charged at the Pay-As-You Go rate.


### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account
