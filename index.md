## Lite account
{: #liteaccount}

Sign up for a Lite account to start building your apps and exploring services with select free Lite plans, which are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](../icons/Lite.svg) in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Your Lite account doesn't expire and your credit card isn't required.

You have access to a single resource group that's created for you and named `Default`. All of your service's instances that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) are automatically added to this resource group. You can update the name of this resource group at any time. See [Renaming a resource group](/docs/resources/resourcegroups.html#renaming-a-resource-group) for the detailed steps.

Each resource group is free. When you create a connection between a service that is managed by IAM and a Cloud Foundry app, you create an alias, which is a service instance, that counts toward your quota. See [Managing connections](/docs/resources/connecting_apps.html#connect_app).
{: tip}

### What's available?
{: #lite-account-features}

Check out the following list of key features that are available in a Lite account:

   * The account is free - no credit card required.
   * The account never expires.
   * You can use one org in one {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region.
   * Basic {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support for free. Basic support is provided for non-production environments or workloads where traditional severities are not used and specific response times are not stipulated.
   * You receive email notifications about your account status and quota limits.
   * Your Cloud Foundry apps can access up to 256 MB of free, instantaneous runtime memory.
   * You can provision one instance of any service in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/?search=label:lite%20lite){: new_window} that has a Lite plan.
   * After 10 days of no development activity, your apps go to sleep. You can start working on new apps without having to worry about exceeding memory quota limits.
   * After 30 days of no development activity, your service instances with Lite plans are deleted. This way, you don't have to manage deleting inactive instances before you create new ones.

### Upgrading your Lite account
{: #upgrade-lite-account}

You can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account or Subscription account. For more information, see [Upgrading your account](/docs/account/account_settings.html#upgrading-account).

You get a promotional credit of $200 after you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, and the credit is automatically applied to your account. Your $200 credit is valid for 30 days and is automatically applied to your invoice. The credit cannot be used with third-party offerings.

## Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #paygo}

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. Your charges are based on your use of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} computing and services. You're eligible for free runtime and service allowances. If you use more than the free allowance, you receive a monthly {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} invoice. The invoice is in United States dollars (USD) and provides details about your resource charges.

Also, with a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can order optional items such as advanced or premium support options. Contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for more information.


### Upgrading your Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #upgrade-to-subscription}

To upgrade your Pay-As-You-Go account to a Subscription account, contact [IBM Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

## Subscription account
{: #subscription-account}

With a Subscription account, you can create multiple resource groups to easily manage quota and view billing usage for a set of resources. You commit to a combined a minimum spending amount each month and receive a subscription discount that is applied to that minimum charge. You're charged the non-discounted rate for any usage that exceeds your total subscription amount. To view your subscription, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Subscriptions**. 

If you have a subscription account, you can create most of the services that are available from the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon"). However, some services use a specific pricing plan that requires you to purchase it separately.

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account
With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, you must sign up for a one year minimum term that includes:

   * VPN connectivity back to your infrastructure
   * Fully redundant environment in a {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} data center
   * All supported runtimes (IBM Java Liberty, Node.js, and built-in open source runtimes)
   * All dedicated services that you selected and all public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services
   * Standard {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support

You can also order optional items such as {{site.data.keyword.BluDirectLink}} or advanced or premium support options. Contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for more information.

What you pay each month during that term is based on the dedicated services that you want, plus a Subscription account that gives you access to all public services. Usage charges of the services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public are calculated based on your Subscription account agreement. You receive an invoice for any services that you use beyond that subscription agreement. Contact your IBM designated account representative or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) to get started on your agreement.
