# Customizing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog for your account
{: #restrict-by-user}

Private catalogs provide a way to centrally manage access to products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize your private catalogs to make specific solutions available to users in your account. By doing so, you can ensure that your catalogs are relevant to your business. 
{: shortdesc}

Let's say you're an operations admin for your team, and you require access to all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. A member of your team is tasked with a specific project, for example, building a voice-enabled chatbot by using {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}. And, you want them to access only those products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.  

To achieve this, you create one catalog that includes all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Then, you create another catalog that includes only the required products, and you give the team member viewer access to the catalog. 

All private catalogs that are in an account inherit filters that are set by the account owner or administrator at the account level. In addition, if the account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters apply to all child account groups and accounts.
{: tip}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-restrict}

You need the [administrator role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management) to complete this task. 

## Creating a private catalog with all products included
{: #catalog-all}

Complete the following steps to create a catalog that includes all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog:

1. In the console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, and click **Create a catalog**.
1. Enter a name, make sure the **Start with all available products in this account** option is selected, and click **Create**. The availability is based on the filters set at the account level on the Settings page. 
2. Confirm that the catalog includes all products by clicking the catalog name > **Manage filters**. Then, check that **Include all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** is selected in **Step 1: Select to include or exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**.

## Creating a private catalog with select products included
{: #catalog-select}

Complete the following steps to create a catalog that includes a specific set of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, and click **Create a catalog**.
2. Enter a name, and click **Create**.
3. Click the catalog name > **Manage filters**.
4. Select **Exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** in **Step 1: Select to include or exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**. 
5. Skip step 2, and click **Add** in **Step 3: Add exceptions to the rules**. 
6. Make sure **Include** is selected as the condition, and then individually select the products you want users to access. In the case of our example project, you select {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}.

## Setting the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #catalog-off}

Now that you've created your private catalogs, complete the following steps to turn off visibility of the public catalog to all users in your account.

1. Click **Catalogs** in the breadcrumb at the top of the page.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Set **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** to **Off**. 
4. Confirm that your filters and settings are correctly applied by going to the public catalog, and expanding the catalog switcher. Only the private catalogs in your account should be displayed in the list. 

## Authorizing access to private catalogs
{: #customcatalog-access}

To authorize users to work with the products in your private catalogs, assign them the [viewer role on the catalog management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#catalog-management-account-management).
