# Closing an account
{: #account-close}

When you no longer need your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account, you can close the account. If there's any way we can assist you before you decide to close your account, [reach out to us](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

## About the account closure process
{: #about-close-account}

To close a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, a support case is required for account security and documentation purposes. Closing your account can't be undone, and your data is unrecoverable. The support case documents your acknowledgment that the account and its data cannot be recovered after closure.

* After your Pay-As-You-Go account is closed, all usage is stopped across all services that are running in your account. The usage that is accrued in the current billing period is sent in one final invoice at the close of the billing period. You might receive a final invoice after you close your account due to incurred charges from the month before the account was closed.

* You can request to cancel your Subscription account before the end of the term, but whether the subscription can be canceled early is at the discretion of IBM. A subscription is a contract between you and IBM that commits you to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for a specific term and spending amount. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

As a user on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can be a member of multiple accounts. If you are not the account owner, you can leave the account. For more information, see [Leaving an account](/docs/account?topic=account-account-membership).
