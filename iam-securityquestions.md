{: tip}

## Setting up security questions
{: #security-questions-setup}

You can set up answers to three security questions for extra authentication at login. You must set up your security questions and answers before your administrator can enable this MFA requirement for you.

To set up your security questions:
1. From the console, go to Go to **{{site.data.keyword.avatar}}** icon ![Avatar icon](../icons/i-avatar-icon.svg) > **Profile and settings**, and select **Login settings**.
2. Click **Set up**.

   If you previously set up security questions, click **Edit**.
3. Select the questions that you want to have and answer them. You must use three security question options.
4. Click **Save** when you're finished.  
5. Select the **Yes** checkbox for the security questions to be enabled. Selecting this option might prompt you to sign in to your account again.  

   If this option isn't selected, you don't have access to turn on security questions. You must be the account owner or have the User-managed login setting that is enabled for you by your account administrator to turn security questions on and off. Contact your account owner or administrator to get access.
