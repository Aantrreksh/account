# FAQs
{: #accountfaqs} 

## Which {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}

In a Lite account, you can work in only one region. In a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can access all regions. 

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle (renewed each month) or on a one-off usage basis. You can have one instance per Lite plan service. Lite pricing plans are offered in all accounts.

## How do I upgrade or change my account type?
{: #changeacct}

* To convert your 30-day trial to a Lite account, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg). After confirming eligibility, the Sales team shares a unique link that you can use to try to convert your account. Successful conversion is not guaranteed as Lite accounts are not entirely compatible with 30-day trials.
