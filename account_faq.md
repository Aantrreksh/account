## What is Cloud Foundry?
{: #cloud-foundry}
{: faq}

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform as a service (PaaS) option available through {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public for building and deploying applications on the cloud. Cloud Foundry organizations and spaces are used to organize resources and apps available within specific regions.

For more information about managing orgs and spaces, see [Adding orgs and spaces](/docs/account?topic=account-orgsspacesusers#orgsspacesusers). And, if youâ€™re interested in learning more about how to provide access to resources in a Cloud Foundry space, see [Cloud Foundry access](/docs/iam?topic=iam-cfaccess#cfaccess).


## Can I move an org to another account?
{: #move-org-diff-account}
{: faq}

Currently, you can't move an org to a different account. However, you can recreate the org with the same credentials in a different account to mimic this functionality. For more information, see [Adding orgs and spaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-orgsspacesusers#createorg).


## Which Cloud Foundry regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}
{: faq}

In a Lite account, you can work in only one region. In a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can access all available regions.


## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}
{: faq}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. You can have one instance per Lite plan service. Lite pricing plans are offered in all accounts. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#accounts).


## What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.

You can check your usage by going to **Manage > Billing and usage** and selecting **Usage**. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).

## How do I delete a service from my account?
{: #accounts-service-removal}
{: faq}

If you want to delete a service, you can do so from the resource list. Learn more in [Working with resources and services](/docs/resources?topic=resources-resources-faq#service-removal).

## How many resource groups, orgs, or spaces can I create?
{: #resourcelimit}
{: faq}

If you have a billable account, there's no limit to the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that you can create within your account. However, if you have a Lite account, you're limited to one org and one resource group.

## How do I upgrade or convert my account type?
{: #changeacct}
{: faq}

If you're not sure of your current account type, you can find it on the Account settings page. Learn more in [Upgrading your account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account).

## If I upgrade my Lite account, can I continue to use my existing instances?
{: #nochange}
{: faq}

Yes, when you upgrade to a billable account, you can continue to use the instances you created with your Lite account.

## How do I update my credit card?

## Can I delete my tag?
{: # delete-tag}
{: faq}

Before you can delete a tag, you must remove it from all resources. If you still can't delete it, the tag might be attached to a resource that you don't have permission to view. The same tag can be attached to several resources by different users in the same billing account. Users don't have the same visibility on all resources on the account.

## Can I rename a tag?
