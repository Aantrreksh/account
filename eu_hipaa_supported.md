# Enabling EU supported, Financial Services Validated, and HIPAA supported settings
{: #eu-hipaa-supported}

If you're the account owner, you can enable your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to be EU supported, Financial Services Validated designated, and HIPAA supported. You can enable the EU Supported setting, for example, if you use resources to process personal data for European citizens. You can enable the Financial Services Validated setting to include and manage regulated financial services information. And, you can enable the HIPAA Supported setting if you plan to include Protected Health Information (PHI) in HIPAA-enabled services.

## Enabling the EU Supported setting
{: #bill_eusupported}

Enabling the EU supported setting limits Advanced Customer Support (ACS) that is provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team members in the European Union region. However, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} processing activities might be performed by teams that are outside of the EU region. Global teams can be contacted when issues aren't resolved by the ACS teams in the EU. The global teams are always contacted at the instruction of the EU support team and only when there's no impact to the security or privacy of your data.

By enabling this setting, EU supported services have strict access controls to ensure the data you store and process is restricted and controlled by the IBM support team in the EU region. If {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} experts that are outside of the European region need access to this data, an EU support team member reviews the access request. The EU support team member provides necessary access to the global cloud expert only to the requested system, and only for a specific timeframe after which access is revoked. Throughout this process, your data is always protected.

   1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
   2. Click **On**.
   3. Read the information about enabling the setting, and select **I understand and agree to these terms**.
   4. Click **On**.

   After you enable the setting, you can use the EU Supported filter option to search the catalog for products that have EU-supported pricing plans.

## Enabling the HIPAA Supported setting
{: #enabling-hipaa}

The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act define standards for handling electronic healthcare transactions and information. If you or your company is a covered entity as defined by HIPAA, you must enable the HIPAA Supported setting if you run sensitive workloads that are regulated under HIPAA and the HITECH Act. Learn more about {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} compliance in [Compliance on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance){: external}.

Enabling this setting has the following effects:

* Enables you to filter on HIPAA Enabled services in the catalog
* Indicates to IBM that your account stores protected health information (PHI)
* Digitally accepts the IBM Business Associate Addendum (BAA) for covered entities

Enable this setting only if you or your company is a covered entity as defined by HIPAA. If you or your company is a business associate of a covered entity, [contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=MAIL-wcp){: external} to accept the applicable BAA.
