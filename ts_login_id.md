# Why was my IBMid or email not recognized?
{: #ts_old_username}

To successfully log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, make sure that you have IBMid authentication for each account.

When you log in to the console, the following message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

`We didn't recognize this IBMid or email.`

You tried to log in to the console, but didn't use a valid IBMid. For example, you didn't enter a fully qualified email address for the IBMid, or you tried to use a previous user name and password.
{: tsCauses}

You must have a valid IBMid and password to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

 * Enter a fully qualified email address for the IBMid.
 {: tsResolve}
 * If you're a SoftLayer user with a SoftLayer ID, you must switch to IBMid authentication in each account that you have access to before you can log in. For more information, see [Switching to IBMid](/docs/account?topic=account-unifyingaccounts).
