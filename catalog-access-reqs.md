# Assigning users access
{: #catalog-access}

As the account owner, you assign users specific access depending on what tasks they are performing. To streamline the process of assigning access, you can use access groups to organize a set of users into a single entity. That way, you can assign a single policy to the group one time, and then add or remove users from the group as needed.

For more details about access management, see [Managing access in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/iam?topic=iam-cloudaccess).

This feature is available only in a closed beta. If youâ€™re interested in participating, contact kala.nenkova@ibm.com.
