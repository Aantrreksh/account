# Assigning catalog management access
{: #catalog-access}

As the account owner, you assign users specific catalog management access depending on what tasks they are performing. To streamline the process of assigning access, you can use access groups to organize a set of users into a single entity. That way, you can assign a single policy to the group one time, and then add or remove users from the group as needed. 
{: shortdesc}

For more details, see [Managing access in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/account?topic=account-cloudaccess).

## Setting up your access groups in the console
{: #catalog-access-groups-console}

See the following sections for details about creating your access groups and assigning specific IAM policies to each one.

### Administrator access
{: #catalog-access-console-admin}

Administrator access is required for setting account-level filters to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.   

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
2. Go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Access groups**.
4. Click **Create**.
5. Enter `private-catalog-admins` as the group name, and click **Create**.
6. Click **Access policies** > **Assign access**.
7. Select **Account management**.

10. Click **Add** > **Assign**.

### Editor access
{: #catalog-access-console-editor}

Editor access is required for creating private catalogs, setting filters at the private catalog level, adding your software to your private catalog, and updating, deprecating, and restoring your software.    

1. Go to **Access groups**, and click **Create**.
2. Enter `private-catalog-editors` as the group name, and click **Create**.
6. Click **Access policies** > **Assign access**.
7. Select **Account management**.

### Viewer access
{: #catalog-access-console-viewer}

Viewer access is required for viewing private catalogs, the filtered {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, and the filter settings.  

1. Go to **Access groups**, and click **Create**.
2. Enter `private-catalog-viewers` as the group name, and click **Create**.
6. Click **Access policies** > **Assign access**.
7. Select **Account management**.

You also need to have viewer access on the resource group to which your private catalog is assigned. You can assign your private catalog to a resource group when you complete the steps for creating your private catalog. For more information, see [Customizing the IBM Cloud catalog for all account users](/docs/account?topic=account-filter-account). 

To assign viewer access to your private catalog's resource group, use the following steps:

1. Go to **Users** and select the user. 
1. Select **Access policies** > **Assign access**. 
1. From the **Assign users additional access** section, select **IAM services**.  
1. Select **All Identity and Access enabled services** and your private catalogs resource group from the **What type of access do you want to assign?** list.
1. In the Platform access section, select the **Viewer** role.
1. Click **Add** > **Assign**.

## Setting up your access groups by using the CLI
{: #catalog-access-groups-cli}

To assign access, run the [`ibmcloud iam user-policy-create`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_user_policy_create) command. 

### Administrator access
{: #catalog-access-cli-admin}

Run the following command to assign administrator access:

```
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create USER_NAME --roles Administrator --service-name globalcatalog-collection
```
{: codeblock}

### Editor access
{: #catalog-access-cli-editor}

Run the following command to assign editor access:

```
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create USER_NAME --roles Editor --service-name globalcatalog-collection
```
{: codeblock}

### Viewer access
{: #catalog-access-cli-viewer}

Run the following command to set viewer access:

```
ibmcloud iam user-policy-create USER_NAME --roles Viewer --service-name globalcatalog-collection
```
{: codeblock}

## Add users to your access groups in the console
{: #catalog-access-console-users}

After you set up your access groups, complete the following steps to add users to the groups:

1. Go to **Users**, and click **Invite users**.
2. Specify the email addresses of the users. If you are inviting more than one user with a single invitation, they are all assigned the same access.
3. Select one of the three access groups you previously created, and click **Add** > **Invite**.
4. Repeat the steps to add users to your other access groups. 

## Add users to your access groups by using the CLI
{: #catalog-access-cli-users}

To add users to an access group by using the CLI, run the [`ibmcloud iam access-group-user-add`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_user_add) command.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-user-add GROUP_NAME USER_NAME [USER_NAME2...]
```
{: codeblock}

For example the following command adds user `name@example.com` to the `example_group` access group.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-user-add example_group name@example.com
```
{: codeblock}
