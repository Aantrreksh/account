You can't upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account.

When you go **Manage** > **Account** > **Account Settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, the following message is displayed:

`You do not have the permissions necessary to view this page. Contact your administrator.`

To upgrade an account, you must have the correct access on all account management services. 
{: tsCauses}

Contact the account owner to request an access policy with the Editor role or higher on all account management services. For more information, see [Upgrading your account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account).
