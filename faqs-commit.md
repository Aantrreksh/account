## What is the difference between Pay-As-You-Go with Committed use and a Subscription account? 
{: #commitment-subscription}
{: faq}

The Pay-As-You-Go with Committed use model is similar to the Subscription model. Unlike a subscription, when you have a commitment, you commit to spend a certain amount and receive discounts across the platform even after your commitment term ends. Any overage that is incurred on the account continues to receive a discount.
