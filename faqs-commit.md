## What is the difference between Enterprise Savings Plan and a Subscription account?
{: #commitment-subscription}
{: faq}

The Enterprise Savings Plan model is similar to the Subscription model. Unlike a subscription, when you have a commitment, you commit to spend a certain amount and receive discounts across the platform even after your commitment term ends. Any overage that is incurred on the account continues to receive a discount.
