By default, {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} is enabled for an account. As an account owner or user with the correct access, you can enable or disable {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} for users in the account.

If the setting is disabled, no users in the account can access {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}}. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_notm}} icon ![{{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_notm}} icon](../icons/terminal-cloud-shell.svg) is disabled in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

## Selecting {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} locations for an account

If this option is not selected, you must select the toggle for each new location that you want to enable as it becomes available.
5. Click **Save changes**.
