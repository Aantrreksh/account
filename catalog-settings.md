# Managing catalog settings
{: #filter-account}

As the account owner or administrator, you can manage the settings for all catalogs across your account. Management tasks include setting the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog and controlling access to products in the public catalog and private catalogs for users in your account.
{: shortdesc}

## Setting the visibility of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #set-public-visibility}

Users in your account have access to all products in the catalog by default. To manage the visibility of the public catalog, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. You need the administrator role on the catalog management service to perform this task.

If you don't have any private catalogs in your account and you turn off the visibility of the public catalog, users can't create instances of any products. Be sure to [create a private catalog](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user) before you update this setting. 
{: note}

## Managing access to products for all users
{: #set-account-filters}

You can use filters to manage which products in the public catalog are available to all users in your account. For example, you might want to restrict access to third-party products. Or, you might want users to work with a specific software type. To manage account-level filters, you need the administrator role on the catalog management service.

If your account is a parent account in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise, the filters that you set apply to all child account groups and accounts. 
{: tip}

1. In the console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Settings**. 
2. Confirm that the visibility of the public catalog is set to **On**.
3. In the What products are available? section, select **Exclude all products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**.
4. Set one or more filters to customize what products are available by category.
5. Add exceptions to the filter rules that you set in the previous step. 
6. Use the **Preview** table to confirm your selections, and click **Update**.

## Managing access to products for specific users 
{: #set-private-filters}

Set filters on a private catalog for fine-grained control of which products in the public catalog are available only to the users you choose. You need the administrator role on the catalog management service to manage filtering at the private catalog level.  

1. In the console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, **Private catalogs**. 
2. Select a catalog from the list to navigate to its details page. 

  The **Products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog** table that's displayed on the page shows the list of products that are available at the account level. The availability is based on the filters the account owner or administator set. Account-level filters apply to all private catalogs that are in the account. 
  {: tip}
  
3. Click **Manage filters**.
3. Select to include or exclude all products in the public catalog. 
4. Set one or more filters to customize what products are available by category. 
5. Add exceptions to the filter rules that you set in the previous step. 
6. Click **Update**. 
7. Go to the Settings page and turn off the visibility of the public catalog.  
7. To give users access to work with the products in the private catalog, assign them the viewer role on the catalog management service.  

For more detailed examples of how you can leverage filtering at the private catalog level, see [Customizing your private catalogs](/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user).
