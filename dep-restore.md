# Deprecating and restoring a version of a software offering
{: #dep-restore}

In this tutorial, you deprecate a version of the apache-two-instances offering. Then, you restore the version to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. 
{: shortdesc}

This feature is available only in a closed beta program. If youâ€™re interested in participating, contact kala.nenkova@ibm.com.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-restore}

To complete this tutorial, you need to be assigned the editor role on the private catalog service. For more information, see [Assigning users access](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-access).

  If you don't see what you're expecting in the console based on your permissions, try refreshing your session by going to https://cloud.ibm.com/login.

1. Click the apache-two-instances offering.
1. Click the **Version** list, and select **2.4.39**. 
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg), and select **Restore**.

## Deprecate a version of a software offering by using the CLI
{: #deprecate-cicd-editor}

You need the version locator for your offering version. To find it, run the `ibmcloud catalog offering list --catalog "My first catalog"` command, and search for version 2.4.39.
{: important}

1. Deprecate a version of your software offering.
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering deprecate --version-locator <VERSION_LOCATOR>
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
1. Search the offerings in the catalog and verify that apache 2.4.39 is deprecated:
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering search --catalog "My first catalog"
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    
## Restore a deprecated version by using the CLI
    
When you restore a deprecated version, you are required to validate and publish the software offering again.

  To find the version-locator for the draft version, run the `ibmcloud catalog offering list --catalog "My first catalog"` command, and search for version 2.4.39-draft.
  {: note}

1. Restore the offering. This action creates a draft version of the deprecated version.
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering restore --version-locator <VERSION_LOCATOR>
    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Validate the offering:
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering validate --version-locator **<VERSION_LOCATOR_OF_DRAFT_VERSION>** --cluster <CLUSTER> --namespace "apache-test-deployment"
    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Merge the draft version. This action automatically makes version 2.4.39 available in the catalog.  
      
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering merge-draft --version-locator **<VERSION_LOCATOR_OF_DRAFT_VERSION>**
    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Search the offerings in the catalog, and verify that apache 2.4.39 is listed.
    ```
    ibmcloud catalog offering get --catalog "My first catalog" --offering "apache"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

### Success criteria
{: #success-cicd-deprecate}

You successfully completed this task if you ran all CLI commands with the expected results.
