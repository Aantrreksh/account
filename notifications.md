# Setting spending notifications
{: #spending}

If you are a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, or spending for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

  1. From the console, click **Manage > Billing and usage**, and then select **Spending notifications**.
  2. Enter a numeric value to set the threshold for triggering a specific type of spending notification:
    * Total account
    * Total runtime
    * Total services
    * Total container
    * Spending for a specific service
  3. Click **Save**.
  
If you have a Lite or trial account, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to set spending limits. For more information about Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, see [Account types](/docs/account/index.html#accounts).
