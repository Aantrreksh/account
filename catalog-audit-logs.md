# Viewing changes to your private catalogs
{: #catalog-audit-logs}

With audit logs you can follow the changes that have been made to your private catalogs. Changes to your private catalog are associated with your account or enterprise account, products, and catalog. 
{: shortdesc} 

To view the audit logs, you need to be a manager of the account the catalog is in or have write access to the catalog. For write access, you need at least editor access on the catalog and the account. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services) for more information.


## Viewing changes
{: #audit-logs-table}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Catalogs** from the console menu bar.
2. Select **Audit logs**. 
3. Filter for the scope you want to see in the table. 

Each event in the audit logs table by default identifies each change with the email of the user that made the change, the type of change, a description of the change, and the date that the change was made.
