# Ordering external authentication MFA for a user
{: #external}

As an administrator with the correct access, you can order external authentication and enable the multifactor authentication (MFA) option for a user's login. You are charged a monthly fee for the external authentication options. This type of multifactor authentication (MFA) is required only for the account where the setting is enabled unlike ID-based MFA. For more information, see [Types of multifactor authentication](/docs/account?topic=account-types).

## Ordering external authentication
{: #ordering}

You can order external authentication for a user if you are the master user or if you have the Manage User and Add/Upgrade Services permissions.

To order external authentication, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**.
2. Select a user from the list.
3. From the **User details** page, select **Order external authentication** in the Manage user's login section.
4. Select **Symantec identity protection** or **Phone-based identity protection**.
    * For Symantec authentication, the user must download the [Symantec VIP](https://vip.symantec.com/){: external} app and obtain a credential ID to continue with the ordering process.
    * For phone-based authentication, you can proceed with the order, but your user must [set up their configuration](/docs/account?topic=account-external#setting-up-phone-based-authentication) before you can enable the option.
5. Based on your selection, follow the prompts to review the price and terms before you place the order.
6. Click **Order** to finalize your selection.

After Symantec authentication is ordered, you can turn on the option for the user from the User details page. And, after phone-based authentication is ordered and then configured by the user, you can turn on the option for the user from the User details page.
