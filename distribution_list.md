# Adding users to a distribution list 
{: add-users-distribution-list}

You can manage the notification distribution list by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. You can create a list of up to 10 email addresses that can receive account-wide notifications. Users that are added to the distribution list are notified about any event that's affecting the account. You must have the editor role or higher on the account management service to add users to the distribution list. For more information, see [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services).
{: shortdesc}

Adding users to the distribution list is different than updating your notification preferences. Users added to the distribution list by the account owner receive any incident, maintenance, announcement, or security bulletin that appears on the account owners [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications){: external} page.
