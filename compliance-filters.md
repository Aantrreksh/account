# Compliance filters
{: #catalog-filter-options}

You can use a set of filters to search the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog for services that meet a specific set of standards.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following list to understand the details about each option:

* **EU Supported**: Support for the service is specifically provided by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support team members located in the European Union (EU) region.
* **HIPAA Enabled**: The service is designated as HIPAA ready, meaning processing, storing, and handling Protected Health Information (PHI) in the service is supported. 
* **IAM-enabled**: The service is enabled to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control. Access policies are used to assign users and service IDs access to specific resources in an account.
* **Service Endpoint Supported**: You can connect to the service over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network instead of the public network. Connecting directly to service endpoints doesn't require internet access, providing increased security.
