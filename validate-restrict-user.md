# Validating filters set at the private catalog level
{: #restrict-user-validate}

In this tutorial, you validate that you can view specific {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} products in the private catalog that you've been given access to. 
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-restrict-validate}

To complete this tutorial, you need to be assigned the viewer role on the catalog management service. With this type of access, you can view only the products included in the filter that the private catalog editor previously set. You can also view what filters the editor set, but you can't update them. For more information, see [Assigning users access](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-access).

  If you don't see what you're expecting in the console based on your permissions, try refreshing your session by going to https://cloud.ibm.com/login.
  {: tip}

## Validate your filtered view by using the console
{: #restrict-filter-validate}

Validate that your private catalog includes {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}:

1. Click **Catalog** in the console menu bar. 
2. Select **My first catalog** from the list of catalogs.
1. Search for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, and confirm that the products are included in the search results. 
<br><br>

Next, validate that you can't edit the catalog settings and filters:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Catalogs**, and select **Settings**. Confirm that you can view the current settings, but you can't update them.
1. Click **Private catalogs** > **My first catalog**.
1. Click **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog products** > **Manage filters**. Confirm that you can view the current filters, but you can't update them. 

## Validate your filtered view by using the CLI
{: #restrict-validate-cli} 

Run the following command to validate that you can view {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} in your private catalog:

  ```
  ibmcloud catalog offering list --catalog "My first catalog"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

## Next steps
{: #next-addsw}

A user creates a private catalog and adds their own software to it. See [Adding your software to a private catalog](/docs/account?topic=account-create-private-catalog) for more information.
