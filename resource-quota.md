# Viewing resource quotas and service limits
{: #view-resource-quota}

This topic is work in progress.
{: note}

The centralized {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} [Quotas and service limits](/account/quotas){: external} provides a way to view and manage usage and quota limits for resources in the infrastructure services, account management, and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM) categories. Quotas refer to the limits in services, the maximum values for resources in your account. If the default limit of resources is not suitable for your business needs, you can request the increase of your resource quota values. By viewing and managing resource quotas and limits, you can ensure efficient resource optimization and prevent overconsumption.

{: #view-quota-resource}

Check the resource quotas in your account to make sure that you optimize your resource usage and maintain resource performance. To view your resource quotas, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage > Account > Quotas and service limits**.
1. Select the category that your resource is associated with.
1. Review the list of resources and click a resource that you want to get more details about.

   You can get more details only about resources associated with the infrastructure services category.    
   {: note}

1. After selecting a resource, you can find more details on the **Resource quota details** side panel, including the default quota limit, the adjusted quota limit, quota scope, current utilization, and quota metric.

    If your resource is at capacity and you reached the default quota limit, create a case in the Support Center to adjust the quota limit. Click **creating a case** on the **Resource quota details** side panel.
