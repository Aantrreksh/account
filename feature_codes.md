# Applying feature codes to Lite accounts
{: #codes}

If you have a Lite account, you can apply feature codes to take advantage of extra {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} resources or capabilities. Feature codes are typically provided for online courses and certain events, such as educational sessions or conference workshops.

{:tip}

You must have an Editor role or higher on all account management services to apply a feature code. The extra resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB that is specified by the code
  * Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans
  * Convert a Lite account to a trial account, which provides access to more services but only within a limited trial period

Complete the following steps to apply a feature code to your account:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.
1. Enter the feature code, which is typically a random alphanumeric value such as `a1b2c3def456`.
1. Click **Apply**.
