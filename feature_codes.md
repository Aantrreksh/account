You must have an Editor role or higher on the Billing service to apply a feature code. In some instances, you might also see these codes referred to as promo codes. The extra resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB that is specified by the code
  * Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans
  * Convert a Lite account to a trial account, which provides access to more services but only within a limited trial period

Complete the following steps to apply a feature code to your account:

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.
1. Enter the feature code, and click **Apply**.
