# Applying feature codes
{: #codes}

Depending on your account type, you can use feature codes to add subscription and support credits, or to take advantage of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} extra resources.
{: shortdesc}


## Adding subscription and support credit
{: #feature-code-billable}

After you purchase subscription or support credit, you add the credit to your account by applying a feature code. Applying the feature codes ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges.

After {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales places the order, an email with the feature code for each subscription and support line item is sent to the appropriate contact. If you purchased a subscription and didn't receive your feature code, [contact us ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} or email Sales at CloudDigitalSales@us.ibm.com to request for it to be sent again.

Only the account owner or a user with the editor or administrator role for the Billing service can apply the feature code. If you don't have access to apply feature codes, the account owner or administrator can provide access as described in [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services).
{: tip}

If you have feature codes for both subscription and support credit, apply the subscription feature code to the account before you apply the support feature code.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.

  Each code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date. Credit that is added to an account cannot be removed.
  {: important}

1. Enter the feature code, and click **Apply**.

   If you have both, first apply the code for subscription credit, then apply the code for support credit.

If you don't know your seller, the codes are applied in the wrong order, or you experience issues with applying the codes, [contact support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).

## Adding extras to Lite accounts
{: #feature-code-lite}

If you have a Lite account, you can use a feature code to unlock extra resources or capabilities. You must have an Editor role or higher on all account management services to apply a feature code.  

1. From the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**.
1. Click **Apply code**.
1. Enter the feature code, and click **Apply**.

The extra resources or capabilities that are provided vary depending on the particular code but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the code
  * Add one organization with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an extra number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans
