# Account management events tracking
{: #accttracking}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account.

As of 9 May 2019 the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} service is deprecated. You must create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} in your account to continue tracking account management events. For more information, see [Deprecation of the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2019/04/deprecating-ibm-cloud-activity-tracker/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

You can track the following events:

* Managing an account by creating an account, updating information, activating an account, or creating a Subscription account
* Adding or removing users
* Creating organizations
