# Account management events tracking
{: #accttracking}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account.

You can track the following events:

* Managing an account by creating an account, updating information, activating an account, or creating a Subscription account
* Adding or removing users
* Creating organizations

To get started with monitoring account actions, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker). For more information about each of the event areas that you can track, see [Account management events](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker?topic=cloud-activity-tracker-at_events_acc_mgt).
