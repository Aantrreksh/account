# Auditing events for account, IAM, catalog management
{: #acct_iam_tracking}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, private catalogs, and with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM).
{:shortdesc}

As of 9 May 2019 the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} service is deprecated. You must create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} in your account to continue tracking account management and IAM events. For more information, see [Deprecation of the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/release-notes/deprecating-ibm-cloud-activity-tracker){: external} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
