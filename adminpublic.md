# Signing up for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}

You can sign up for an [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") by using an existing IBMid, creating a new IBMid, or by using a federated ID.

A federated ID can be used to sign up for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} only if your company is already registered with IBM. Registering a company's domain with IBM enables users to log in to IBM products and services by using their existing company user credentials. Authentication is then handled by your company's identity provider. When you log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with a federated ID, you're prompted to log in through your company's login page. For more information, see [IBMid Enterprise Federation Adoption Guide ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://ibm.box.com/v/IBMid-Federation-Guide){: new_window}. An IBM sponsor, such as an offering advocate or client advocate, is required when you request to register federated IDs.

IBM uses the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) for this identity federation. SAML 2.0 is a standard version for exchanging authentication data between security domains. It's an XML-based protocol that uses a security token that contains assertions to pass information between the organizations "Identity Provider", and the "IBM Rely Party (RP)" otherwise known as the Service Provider.
