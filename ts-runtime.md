# How did I exceed the runtime memory allowance?
{: #noruntimemem}
{: troubleshoot}

You went over the allowed memory for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account.

You're unable to deploy apps, and an error states that you've exceeded your organization's memory limit.
{: tsSymptoms}

In a Lite account, your Cloud Foundry apps can use up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. In billable accounts, there's a 2 GB memory limit.
{: tsCauses}

If you're using a Lite account, you can get more memory by upgrading to a billable account. Go to **Manage > Account** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, and select **Account settings**. For more information about Lite account features, see [Lite account](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#liteaccount).
{: tsResolve}

If you don't want to upgrade from a Lite account but have some idle apps, you can delete them to free up some runtime memory.
