# Why can't a user in my account access all instances of a service?
{: #troubleshoot-instances}
{: troubleshoot}

If a user in your account can't access all instances of a service, you might need to update the type of access they're assigned.
{: shortdesc}

You defined a policy that assigns access to a specific service for a user in your account, but they can't access all instances of the service.
{: tsSymptoms}
   
You might need to update the access policy. The issue can be caused by the following reasons:
{: tsCauses}

* The user is not included the correct access group.
* The user is not assigned the correct role.
* The access management tag that's defined in the policy isn't correct. The tag in your policy must be the same tag that is attached to the instances of the service.
* The resource has a context-based restriction that excludes the user.

Check the user's level of access.
{: tsResolve}

1. Go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** in the console, and select the user from the list on the **Users** page.
2. To view the level of access that's defined in a specific policy, click **Access policies**.
3. To view the policies that are assigned to an access group the user is a member of, click **Access groups** > **_group-name_** > **Access policies**.

To view the allowed actions for each role, click **Actions for role**.
{: tip}

To check the name of the access management tag that's attached to the service, complete the following steps: 

1. Click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Resource List**.
2. Locate the service in the table, and see the Tags column. 

To help you quickly identify which tags are access management tags, the name is preceded by `IAM` in the label, for example, `IAM | devtools:project1`. 
{: tip}

To check the context-based restrictions on a resource, complete the following steps: 

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Context-based restrictions**, and select **Rules**.
1. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") on the rule for your service. 
1. Click **Details**. 
1. Take note of the contexts for the rule. Access is granted by a rule only when at least one of the rule's contexts are satisfied by the user.
