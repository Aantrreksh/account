   * [Invite users to the enterprise account](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamuserinv)
   * [View and manage subscription credit](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions)

Also, you can rename your enterprise by clicking **Rename** in the Enterprise details section.

## Managing your enterprise from the CLI
{: #enterprise-manage-cli}

* View enterprise information such as the name, domain, owner, and creation and update dates.
