# Signing up for the Enterprise Savings Plan pricing model
{: #commitment-signup}

Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan pricing model. The Enterprise Savings Plan is similar to the subscription model, but with additional benefits.
{: shortdesc}

You commit to spend a certain amount on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and are billed monthly based on your usage. Unlike the subscription model, any discount you have is available for the duration of the commitment term, even if you reach your committed amount. Any overage incurred receives the discount.

## Before you begin
{: #commit-prereq}

You must have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. To view your account type, go to the [Account settings](/account/settings) in the console to view the account ID and account type.

## How to sign up for Enterprise Savings Plan
{: #signup-paygo-commit}

You must work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan pricing model. The sales team creates a commitment quote based on the spending amount for a certain period of time you want to commit to.

After you accept the commitment quote, you will receive an additional email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment was added to your account.
