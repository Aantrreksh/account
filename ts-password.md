# Why is my password incorrect?
{: #ts_logintoibm}
{: troubleshoot}

You must have a valid password that's associated with your IBMid or SoftLayer ID to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

When you try to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the following error message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

`The password that you entered is not correct.`

The password that you used to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} isn't valid.
{: tsCauses}

Use one of the following options:
{: tsResolve}
 * Go to the [My IBM profile page ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://myibm.ibm.com/dashboard/){: external} to confirm that you're using a valid password.
 * If you forgot your password, click **Forgot your password** to reset your password.
 * If you forgot your IBMid or continue to have problems with your password, contact the Worldwide IBM Registration Help Desk for help.

If you sign in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and the log in process is disrupted for any reason, like resetting your password, return to the console and start the log in process again.
