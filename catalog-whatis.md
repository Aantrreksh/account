## Walking through the tutorials
{: catalogs-get-started}

The catalog management tutorials walk you through the steps for restricting the type of offerings, services and software, that users can access from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. You can learn how to tailor the list of available offerings for different groups of users in your account. Also, you can add Helm charts or Terraform-based software offerings to your account for users to consume.
