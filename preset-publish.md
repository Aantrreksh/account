# Making your preset configuration available to users
{: #publish-preset}

To make your preset configuration available to users, you must share it. You can share your preset configuration with your account, an enterprise, allowlisted accounts, or publicly to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-publish-preset}

You need Editor access on the catalog that the preset configuration is in to share it. For more information, see [Assigning catalog management access](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-access).



If you want to share your preset configuration publicly to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, select a parent product for the preset configuration. You must have editor access to the parent product, and it must be published to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. If you donâ€™t select a parent, you can still share your preset configuration to your account or enterprise, but you won't be able to publish it publicly.
