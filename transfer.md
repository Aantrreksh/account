# Transferring ownership of your account
{: #transfer}

You can transfer your entire {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account to a different owner by updating the company profile. If you need to transfer an account from another owner, create a support case with your company information.

Only Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts can be transferred.

You can transfer ownership of individual resources within your account by using the `ibmcloud catalog` command. For more information, see [Transferring ownership of a private resource](/docs/account?topic=account-include#owners).

## Transferring an account from another owner
{: #transfer-lost}

If the owner of an account left your company and you need to transfer the account to a new owner, you must submit a support case. In the support case, you'll need to attach an official document from your company that contains the following information.
- Your official company letterhead
- Your company's article of incorporation, if applicable
- A statement that the individual is no longer associated with your company
- An explanation that you want the account owner to be changed to a new owner
- The first and last name of the new account owner
- The email address and phone number of the new account owner
- A signature of an executive at your company
- The account number of the account to transfer

   When you're logged in to the account, you can find the account number in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu bar next to the account name. For example, you might see "1234567 - IBM", where the account number is 1234567.
