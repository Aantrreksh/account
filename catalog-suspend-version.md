# Suspending a version of a private product
{: #suspend-product}

If you need to remove a version of your software that's published to your account, you can suspend it for a short time without permanently deleting or deprecating it. Suspending a product can be useful if, for example, you discover a bug or a vulnerability in your product that must be investigated before more users install it. 
{: shortdesc}

<!-- Deprecation note should be added back in to this topic when deprecation goes live in September 2021 
Suspending your product will not permanently delete it from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. If you need to permanently delete your product, deprecate it instead. 
{: note}-->

Complete the following steps to suspend your version: 

<!-- STAGING ONLY: Link to PC in step 1. Confirming that the menu entry isn't available. If not the case, need to revert to original. -->
<!-- Original: In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Sell** > **Team**. -->

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Catalogs** > **Private catalogs**.
1. Select the private catalog where your product is located.
1. Select your product. 
1. Select the version you want to suspend. 
   
   If your software has only one published version, and you suspend that version, the entire product is suspended. 
   {: note}

1. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Suspend**. 
1. Click **Suspend**. 

You can also suspend a version by clicking the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg "Actions") for that version and selecting **Suspend**.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can suspend your product if there's an issue that you need to address. Any updates that you need to make are shared by email.
